/**
 * This package defines event related structures.
 *
 * <p>
 * This structure is based off of Team Catgirl's `pounce`, a lightweight EventBus with a well-written implementation.
 * Concerns for pounce consisted of JVM performance, however do not effect the developer or user at a human level.
 *
 * This package expands on the concept for more usages in a more enterprise-like scale.
